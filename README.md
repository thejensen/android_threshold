#### _...is a work in progress!_
Who knows who will change the world if they don’t show up?

The Goal of I’ll Go if You Go is to encourage offline political action. Anyone who tentatively interested in an in-person political event, rally, or other conference can post the event they want to go to, and request that others join them. Other people can say they’ll go too, and communicate up until the event expires.

By sharing the stats or attendees of any event on social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram), other people will see their friends out and about.

I Go if You’ll Go may increase the attendance of political / advocacy events, which would encourage those sponsoring organizations to continue their efforts.
