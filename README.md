llll# android_political-activism-tracker

#### _...is a work in progress!_
Who knows who will change the world if they don’t show up?

The Threshold is to encourage offline political action. Anyone who tentatively interested in an in-person political event, rally, or other conference can post the event they want to go to, and request that others join them. Other people can say they’ll go too.

Threshold may increase the attendance of political / advocacy events, which would encourage those sponsoring organizations to continue their efforts.
